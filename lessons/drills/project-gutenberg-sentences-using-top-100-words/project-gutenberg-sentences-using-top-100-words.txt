we
not
Men?
Are
you
a
man?'
Are
you
for
it?
Are
you
there?'
As
you
Like
it.
Be
it
so,
then!
Be
it
so,
then.
But
after
that?
But
could
you?'
But
he
did
not.
But
he
said
no.
But
it
did
not.
But
it
is
over!
But
it
was
not.
But
no
one
had.
But
not
by
him.
But
then,
what?
But
what
a
man!
But
what
is
he?
But
what
is
it?
But,
what
then?
Can
that
be
so?
Can
this
be
so?
Can
you
see
it?
Can
you
see
me?
Did
you
see
it?
Do
as
you
will.
Do
you
know
it?
Do
you
know
me?
Do
you
not
see?
Do
you
see
her?
Do
you
see
him?
Do
you,
do
you?
Down
with
him!'
Down
with
them!
For
it
was
she!
For
such
as
he?
He
can
have
me.
He
did
not
see.
He
has
said
so.
He
has,
has
he?
He
may
have
it.
He
said
it
was.
He
should
then.
In,
in,
in,
in!
In,
in,
in,
in.
Is
any
one
up?'
Is
he
not
hers?
Is
it
all
over?
Is
it
any
good?
Is
it
but
this?
Is
not
that
he?
Is
not
that
it?
Is
not
that
so?
Is
not
this
he?
Is
not
this
so?
Is
there
a
man?
It
is
all
over!
It
is
all
over.
It
is
for
you!'
It
is
my
will…
It
is
not
that.
It
is
over
now.
It
may
do
good.
It
must
not
be!
It
must
not
be.
It
was
for
me!'
It
was
for
you.
It
will
not
do.
May
be;
may
be.
May
this
be
so?
Me
and
my
like.
More
than
that!
More
than
that.
More
than
this.
No
it
were
not.
No
more
but
so?
No
more
of
him!
No
more
of
him.
No
one
but
me!'
No
one
can
see!
No
women
about?
No,
he
did
not.
No,
he
had
not.
No,
he
has
not.
No,
it
was
not.
No,
no,
no,
no!
No,
not
at
all.
No,
this,
this!
No--is
that
so?
No;
not
at
all.
No;
not
to
you.
Not
at
all
so.'
Not
before
her!
Not
know
of
me.
Not
that
woman!
Not
this
time!'
Not
to
be
good!
Now
we
see
him.
Now
what
is
it.
Now,
now,
now!'
Now,
then;
now.
Now,
will
you?'
On
him,
on
him!
One
of
the
two.
Said
he
not
so?
She
had
it
not.
She
is
a
woman.
She
is,
is
she?
She
may
be
now.
She
was
for
me.
She
would
know!
So
be
it,
then!
So
be
it,
then.
So
it
was
then!
So
much
for
me.
So
much
for
us.
So
there
it
is.
So,
so,
so,
so!
Such
as
it
was.
That
is
not
so.
That
they
were!
That
they
were.
That
would
be…
The
good
of
it!
The
woman,
man!
There
he
is!...
There
it
is!...
There
must
be.'
There
they
are!
There
they
are.
There
you
are!'
There
you
are.'
There
you
were!
There,
good-by!
There,
you
see!
There,
you
see?
There--you
see!
They
all
do
it.
They
like
this.
They
the
first.
This
as
to
men.
This
is
no
man!
This
is
not
it.
This
is
not
so.
To
me
you
did.'
To
what
other?'
Up
and
at
them.
Was
it
not
so?'
We
all
do
that.
We
can
have
it.
We
can
see
now.
We
do
not
know.
We
must
be
one.
Were
there
two?
Were
they
not?'
Were
you
there?
What
about
her?
What
about
him?
What
about
you?
What
are
these?
What
are
they?'
What
can
he
do?
What
can
it
be?
What
can
we
do?
What
did
he
do?
What
is
in
you?
What
is
it
all?
What
is
it
for?
What
is
it
not?
What
is
it
now?
What
is
to
do?'
What
may
it
be?
What
now,
then?
What
was
that?'
What
were
they?
What
with
him?'
What
would
you?
When
the
First.
When
was
this?'
Which
are
they?
Which
is
which?
Who
can
it
be?'
Who
is
the
man?
Who
said
that?'
Who
then
is
it?
Who
was
the
he?
Will
it
not
be?
Will
you
do
it?
With
no
woman.'
Would
he
do
it?
Would
they
not?
You
can
do
it!'
You
do,
do
you?
You
know
it
is.
You
know
that…
You
know
that.'
You
must
do
it.
You
will
do
it?
'Good
for
you!'
'Have
you,
now?
'There,
there!'
'Who
is
there?'
"All
this
time?"
"And
from
what?"
"And
is
it
not?"
"And
it
is----?"
"And
that
is--?"
"And
the
first?"
"And
the
other?"
"And
the
woman?"
"And
were
they?"
"And
what
then?"
"And
what
with?"
"And
who
is
he?"
"And
who
is
it?"
"Any
men
on
it?"
"Are
there
any?"
"Are
you
there?"
"Be
it
so
then!"
"But
know
what?"
"But
not
on
us!"
"But
these
two."
"But
what
more?"
"But
what
then?"
"But
which
one?"
"But
who
is
he?"
"But
with
what?"
"But
you
could?"
"Can
it
be
you?"
"Can
you
do
it?"
"Did
he
before?"
"Do
you
see
it?"
"Down
with
him!"
"Down
with
you!"
"For
by-and-by."
"For
that
only?"
"From
me,
then?"
"Good
for
that!"
"Good-by,
then."
"Have
you
them?"
"He
did
it,
he!"
"He
may
not
be."
"If--if
we
can."
"Is
he
two
men?"
"Is
it
so
good?"
"Is
there
what!"
"It
is
no
good!"
"It
is
so
said."
"It
must
be
he."
"It
must
be
me."
"It
must
be
so."
"It
was
on
him!"
"Men,
or
women?"
"No,
we
do
not!"
"Not
like
this!"
"Now,
have
you?"
"Only
a
little."
"Over
with
you!"
"See
that,
now!"
"She
said
that?"
"Should
it
not?"
"So
it
is
said."
"So
now
there!'"
"Some
one
must!"
"That
he
would!"
"That
you
have."
"The
only
time."
"There
are
two!"
"There
must
be."
"There
you
are!"
"This
is
great!"
"Time
for
what?"
"What
about
it?"
"What
about
me?"
"What
are
they?"
"What
have
you?"
"What
if
it
is?"
"What
is
great?"
"What
was
that?"
"What
will
you?"
"What
you
know?"
"When
was
that?"
"When
was
this?"
"When
you
like."
"Which
is
that?"
"Who
are
these?"
"Who
can
he
be?"
"Who
can
it
be?"
"Who
is
that--!"
"Who
may
he
be?"
"Who
said
that?"
"Who
was
there?"
"Who
were
they?"
"With
them
all."
"Would
he,
now!"
"Would
you
not?"
"You
are
a
man."
"You
are
a
one!"
"You
can
do
it!"
"You
have
some!"
"You
have
some?"
"You
have
them?"
"You
know
that!"
"You
know
that."
"You
know
what."
"You
see,
then?"
"You
should
be."
"You
were
then."
(Which
she
did.)
--
"What
is
it?"
--
But
for
what?
--
You
will
not.
--And
would
you?
--What
was
that?
--Who
may
he
be?
After
some
time.
And
after
that?'
And
did
they
so?
And
is
that
all?
And
is
this
all?
And
she
to
you?'
And
so
they
are.
And
so
will
you.
And
so
with
men.
And
that
is
all.
And
that
is
all?
And
that
was
it?
And
they
did
so.
And
this
he
did.
And
what
is
it?'
And
what
of
him?
And
what
was
he?
And
what
was
it?
And
who
is
that?
And
who
was
she?
And
you
said
no.
And--and--good?'
Are
you
a
woman?
Are
you
not
out?
Are
you
of
them?
Are
you
so
much?
As
to
the
first.
But
for
a
woman!
But
is
this
all?
But
it
was
more.
But
it
will
not.
But
men
are
men.
But
no
more
now.
But
she
did
not.
But
that
is
all.
But
there
it
is.
But
this
is
not.
But
this
is
one.
But
we
may
know.
But
we
must
see.
But
we
will
see.
But
what
of
him?
But
what
was
it?
But
which
is
it?
But
who
are
you?
But
who
is
this?
But
who
was
she?
But
you
know
me.
But,
what,
what!
But--but--but--.
Can
you
do
that?
Can
you
not
see?
Did
you
do
that?
Did
you
see
him?
Did
you
see
it?'
Do
as
you
like.'
Do
good
with
it.
Do
you
know
her?
Do
you
know
him?
Do
you
know
it?'
Do
you
know
me?'
Do
you
like
her?
Do
you
like
him?
Do
you
like
it?'
Do
you
not
know?
Do
you
see
that?
Do
you
see
this?
Do
you,
for
two.
For
this
woman…
Have
at
you
now!
He
can,
he
will!
He
did
not
know.
He
is
not
that.'
He
is
not
there.
He
is
there
now.
He
said
no
more.
Hers
it
was
not.
Is
he
not
very…
Is
it
your
will?
Is
not
that
it?'
Is
this
the
Man?
It
could
not
be.
It
is
like
this.
It
is
not
to
be!
It
is
the
woman.
It
was
all
over.
It
was
from
him.
It
was
not
that.
It
would
not
do.
May
a
man
do
it?
May
we
see
them?
No
more
of
that!
No
more
of
that.
No
more
of
this!
No
more
of
this.
No,
before
that!
No,
he
must
not.
No,
it
has
not.'
No,
no-no,
no
!'
No,
not
so
very.
No,
she
did
not.
No,
she
was
not.
No,
there
it
is!
No,
we
are
not.'
No:
what
was
it?
Not
at
all
more.
Not
one
of
them.
Not
so--not
all.
Not
that--not--?
Not
to
them
all.
Now
have
at
him!
Now
you
know
it.
Now,
there,
now!
Of
this
no
more!
Or
so
they
said.
Or
what
are
you?
Over
after
over.
See
who
that
is.
See--now--that!'
She
said
it
all.
She
was
a
woman.
She
will
not
be.
Should
he
do
it?
So
much
for
him.
So
now
you
know.
So
that
was
she!
So
you
are,
you.
Some
other
time.
Some
time,
then?
Such
are
not
we.
Than
some
women.
That
is
not
all.
That
is
the
man.
That
may
not
be.
That
was
a
time!
That
will
be
it!
Then
it
was
she!
Then
to
the
man.
There
are
some.'
There
is
no
one.
They
were
great!
They
were
these.
This
is
not
all.
This
is
the
man.
This
may
do
now.
This
may
not
be!
To
be
one
of
us.
Upon
your
what?'
Very,
very
much.
Was
it
not
this?
We
had
you
then.
We
must
have
it!
We
must
see
him!
We
said
no
more.
Were
you
there…
What
about
her?'
What
about
him!'
What
about
him?'
What
about
this?
What
about
what?
What
can
it
be?'
What
can
it
not?
What
can
you
do?
What
could
have!
What
did
he
do?'
What
did
he
see?
What
did
she
do?
What
did
you
do?
What
do
you
do?'
What
do
you
see?
What
if
they
do?
What
if
we
are?'
What
is
he
now?'
What
is
it
like?
What
is
it
more?
What
is
it
then?
What
may
you
be?
What
time
is
it?
What
was
it
all?
What
was
it
for?
What
were
these?
What
were
they?'
What
will
we
do?
What
woman
then?
When
will
it
be?
Which
one
is
it?
Who
can
they
be?
Who
can
this
be?
Who
could
it
be?
Who
had
it
then?
Who
is
the
man?'
Who
is
this
man?
Who
is
with
him?
Who
may
that
be?
Who
may
this
be?
Who
was
the
man?
Will
she
do
it?'
Will
you
do
it?'
Will
you
see
it?
Would
she
other?
You
are
not
his.
You
are
so
good.
You
can
do
this.
You
do
not
know?
You
do
not
like?
You
do
not,
you!
You
have
that...
You
know
me
not?
You
know
of
her.
You
know
you
do.
You
may
do
that.
You
said
it
was.
You
see,
do
you?
'And
with
that?'
'In
what,
then?'
'There
you
are!'
'What
was
that?'
"And
about
what?"
"And
after
that?"
"And
all
for
me!"
"And
so
we
will!"
"And
such
a
one!"
"And
what
is
he?"
"And
what
is
it?"
"And
what
to
do?"
"And
who
was
he?"
"Are
we
not
Men?"
"But
after
that?"
"But
what
is
it?"
"But
what
of
it?"
"But
what,
miss?"
"But
who
is
she?"
"But
who
was
it?"
"But,
would
you?"
"But--a--
which?"
"Can
he
do
that?"
"Can
it
be
they?"
"Can
this
be
it?"
"Can
we
see
him?"
"Can
you
see
me?"
"Did
he
do
that?"
"Did
you
see
it?"
"Did
you
see
us?"
"Do
as
you
like."
"Do
it,
and
see!"
"Do
they
see
us?"
"Do
what
he
did!"
"Do
you
know
it?"
"Do
you
know
me?"
"Do
you
like
it?"
"Do
you
not
see?"
"Do
you
see
him?"
"Down
with
them!"
"Have
some
more?"
"Have
the
which?"
"He
can--he
can!"
"He
has
but
one."
"He--of
all
men!"
"Is
it
about
us?"
"Is
it
all
over?"
"Is
it
like
him?"
"Is
it
this
one?"
"Is
it
to
be
so?"
"Is
not
that
so?"
"Is
not
this
so?"
"Is
that
not
so?"
"It
did
me
good."
"It
is
all
over."
"It
is
he,
then."
"It
is
not
much."
"It
is
not
that."
"It
is
now
what?"
"It
must
be
him."
"It
will
be
you!"
"No,
he
did
not."
"No,
he
has
not."
"No,
not
at
all."
"No,
what
is
it?"
"No--is
that
so?"
"Not
so
much
so?"
"Of
all
of
them."
"Or
if
you
were."
"Over
with
them!"
"See
there,
now!"
"So
be
it,
then."
"So
that
was
it?"
"That
it
is
not!"
"Then
who
is
he?"
"There
is
a
man?"
"There
they
are!"
"There,
you
see!"
"They
are
not--?"
"They
are
there!"
"To
which
of
us?"
"We
do
not
know."
"Were
you
there?"
"What
about
him?"
"What
about
you?"
"What
can
he
be?"
"What
can
it
be?"
"What
can
we
do?"
"What
did
he
do?"
"What
do
you
do?"
"What
for,
then?"
"What
is
he
now?"
"What
is
it
for?"
"What
is
it
now?"
"What
may
it
be?"
"What
were
they?"
"What
would
you?"
"What,
upon
her?"
"What--what
man?"
"Which
is
which?"
"Who
is
the
man?"
"Who
may
she
be?"
"Will
you
do
it?"
"Will
you
do
so?"
"Would
you,
now?"
"You
do
like
it?"
"You
know,
then?"
"You
will,
then?"
'And
who
are
you?
(This
was
to
me.)
--
And
what
then?
--What
is
it
for?
--What
is
it
now?
A
little
or
much?
All
in
good
time.
All
that
for
her!
All
that
is
good.
All
that
is
over.
All
this
we
know.
And
after--after!
And
all
for
what?
And
are
not
you?'
And
is
that
all?'
And
is
this
all?'
And
not
only
she.
And
our
good
his.
And
that
was
all.
And
that
was
all?
And
there
for
me.
And
this
is
all?'
And
what
is
that?
And
what
is
this?
And
what
of
that?
And
what
said
he?
And
who
are
they?
And
who
are
you?'
And
who
made
it?'
And
who,
and
who?
And
will
he
not?'
And
will
they
so?
And
you
have
her.
And
you
have
him?
Any
time
will
do.
Are
you
a
woman?'
Are
you
not
good?
As
you
will
then.
Be
this
from
me!'
Before
and
after.
But
he
could
not.
But
he
was
great.
But
is
there
any?
But
it
is
not
so.
But
only
in
that.
But
see,
but
see.
But
so
we
all
do.
But
that
was
all.
But
there
he
was.
But
there
it
was.
But
this
was
all.
But
we
can
do
it.
But
what
is
that?
But
what
is
this?
But
what
of
that?
But
what
of
this!
But
what
of
this?
But
who
was
this?
But
you
will
see.
But,
as
you
will!
But,
do
you
know?
By-and-by,
then.'
Can
this
be
all?'
Did
he
know
that?
Did
you
like
it?'
Did
you
see
that?
Do
then,
said
he.
Do
you
know
her?'
Do
you
know
that?
Do
you
know
them?
Do
you
know
what?
Do
you
not
know?'
Do
you
see
that?'
Do
you
see
this?'
Down,
down,
down.
From
what,
then?'
He
could
not
see.
He
did
it
for
me.
He
did
not
do
so.
He
did,
you
know.
He
is
a
good
man.
He
is
what
he
is.
He
must
be
there!
He
said
he
would.
He
was
not
there.
If
it
was
it
was.
If
she
is
there!'
If
so,
upon
what?
If
there
is
one!'
If
this
were
so.]
If
you
can
do
it.
Is
it
not*******.
Is
not
this
good?
Is
she
like
you?'
Is
that
the
man?'
It
is
all
on
me.'
It
may
have
been.
It
may
not
be
so.
It
must
be
great!
It
should
not
be.
It
was
her
first.
It
was
like
this.
It
was
not
there.
It
was
not
to
be.
It
was
she,
then!
Know
you
the
man?
My
will
was
good.
No
man
must
know.
No
more
there
is!
No
more,
no
more.
No,
but
are
you?'
No,
it
is
not
so?
No,
it
will
not.'
No,
no,
said
she.
No,
not
for
good.
No,
they
are
not.
No--you
must
not.
No:
he
would
not.
Not
for
that
one.
Not
from
any
one!
Not
now,
not
now.
Not
she;
not
she.
Not
so
this
time.
Not
with
her
now.
Now
he
would
see!
Now
is
the
time.'
Now
that
is
good.
Now
they
know
it.
Now
was
the
time.
Now,
who
are
you.
One
up,
one
down.
Only
for
my
good.
Or
some
one
must.
Said
he
was
a--!'
See
now,
see
now!
She
and
no
other.
She
can
be
made…
She
did
not
know.
She
has
said
it?'
She
is
one
of
us.
She
said
no
more.
She
will
not
see.
So
much
for
that.
So
much
the
more.
So
should
we
all.
So
should
you
be.
So
you
said
then.
So,
that
will
do.
Some
of
you
have.
That
he
have
his.
That
is
about
it.
That
is
no
good.'
That
is
not
good.
That
must
not
be!
That
must
not
be.
That
that
was
so.
That
was
a
woman.
That
will
not
do.
Then
he
is
there?
Then
it
was
you?'
Then
what
was
it?
Then,
what
is
he?
There
she
is----!
There
they
are...
There
we
have
it!
There;
in
there!'
There;
very
good!
They
all
know
me.
They
are
not
you.
They
did
it
then.
They
do
his
will.
They
do
you
good.
This
he
would
do.
This
must
not
be!
This
was
not
all.
This
you
must
do.
Was
he
not
there?
Was
he
now
there?
Was
to
have
been?
We
all
know
that.
We
can
do
it
now.
We
may
have
time.
We
must
know
men.
We
must,
we
must!
We
will,
we
will.
Were
you
of
them?
What
a
man
it
is!
What
about
women?
What
can
they
do?
What
can
this
be!
What
could
he
do?
What
could
it
be?
What
could
we
do?
What
did
they
do?
What
did
you
see?
What
do
you
know?
What
her
is
this?
What
if
they
had?
What
is
all
this?
What
is
he
about?
What
is
it
about?
What
is
it
like?'
What
is
it
then?'
What
is
it
to
be?
What
is
it
to
me?
What
is
it,
then?
What
is
this
man?
What
is,
we
know.
What
man
is
that?
What
man
is
this?
What
may
she
not?
What
may
that
be?
What
men
are
you?
What
of
it,
then?
What
then
was
it?
What
time
is
it?'
What
was
he
like?
What
was
he
then?
What
was
it
like?
What
was
it
then?
What
will
he
do?'
What
will
she
do?
What
will
you
do?
What
would
it
be?
What,
what,
what!
What,
what,
what?
When
is
it
to
be?
When
is
the
time?
Who
are
you
then?
Who
could
it
be?'
Who
is
your
man?'
Who
should
it
be?
Who
was
it,
then?
Who
was
that
man?
Who
was
the
man?'
Who
was
this
man?
Who
was
with
him?
Will
that
do
now?
Will
you
do
that?
Will
you
do
this?
Will
you
then
do?
With
him,
we
may.
You
are
good
men.
You
are,
are
you?
You
could
see
it.
You
did,
did
you?
You
had
it
first.
You
know
he
will.
You
know
my
will.
You
know
the
man!
You
know
you
are.
You
know
you
did.
You
must
know
it.
You
must
no
more.
You
will
see
her.
You
will
see
who.
'Are
we
in
time?'
'Is
she
like
me?'
'What--is--this?'
"About
that
time."
"About
what
time?"
"And
is
that
all?"
"And
is
this
all?"
"And
that
be
all?"
"And
was
that
it?"
"And
what
did
he?"
"And
what
do
you?"
"And
what
of
him?"
"And
what
was
it?"
"And
who
are
you?"
"And
who
is
that?"
"And
who
is
this?"
"And
will
he
not?"
"As
much
as
that?"
"Before
the
what?"
"But
what
of
her?"
"But
what
of
him?"
"But
what
then--?"
"But
who
are
you?"
"But
who
is
this?"
"But
who
was
she?"
"But
you
did
not?"
"Can
you
do
this?"
"Could
you
not--?"

she
see
him?"

she
see
you?"

you
know
it?"

you
see
her?"

you
see
him?"

you
know
her?"
"Do
you
know
him?"
"Do
you
like
him?"
"Do
you
see
that?"
"Do
you
see
this?"
"From
that
woman?"
"Has
she
so
much?"
"Have
you
see
it?"
"Is
he
like
that?"
"Is
it
all
there?"
"Is
she
like
him?"
"Is
this
the
man?"
"Is--is
that
you?"
"It
could
not
be!"
"It
is
only
that!"
"It
is
very
good."
"It
must
be
that!"
"Me,
if
you
like."
"My
little
woman!"
"No,
all
is
over!"
"No,
very
little."
"No,
you
did
not!"
"No,
you
may
not."
"No;
that
is
all."
"Now
out
upon
it!"
"Now
up
with
you!"
"Now
you
know
me."
"Or
what
is
this?"
"So
much
as
that!"
"So
much
as
that?"
"So
there
we
are!"
"Such
is
my
will."
"That
is
my
will."
"That
is
the
man."
"Then
what
is
it?"
"Then
who
is
he?…
"Then
who
was
it?"
"Then,
then
what?"
"This
is
the
man."
"This
must
be
he."
"Was
he
not
made?"
"What
about
them?"
"What
are
you
at?"
"What
can
you
do?"
"What
did
he
see?"
"What
did
you
do?"
"What
do
they
do?"
"What
do
you
see?"
"What
good
is
it?"
"What
if
she
had?"
"What
is
he
like?"
"What
is
in
them?"
"What
is
in
this?"
"What
is
it
like?"
"What
is
it
then?"
"What
like
is
he?"
"What
time
is
it?"
"What
will
he
do?"
"Which
one,
then?"
"Who
can
that
be?"
"Who
can
this
be?"
"Who
is
he,
then?"
"Who
is
it,
then?"
"Who
is
that
man?"
"Who
is
this
man?"
"Who
is
with
him?"
"Who
was
it
then?"
"Who
was
the
man?"
"Would
you
do
it?"
"You
do
not
know!"
"You
do
that
now."
"You
must
do
so.'"
"You
would
do
so?"
'"So
it
was
said."
'Now,
all
is
over.
'What
can
you
do?'
--
As
good,
is
it?
--
This
as
it
may!
--Can
you
do
them.
--Then
what
is
it?
--What
about
that?
...
Are
you
there?
A
man
was
with
me.
A
man,
as
you
are.
A
woman
and
a
man.
After
what
you
...
All
in
good
time!'
All
or
not
at
all.
And
are
they
good?
And
are
who
what?'
And
if
it
is
not?'
And
she
has
been.'
And
the
other
one?
And
there
you
are!
And
what
about
us?
And
what
are
you?'
And
what
is
that?'
And
what
is
there?
And
what
said
he?'
And
you
and
me--?'
And--is
that
good?
And--only
a
woman!
But
hers
were
not.
But
if
it
were
so?
But
it
was
not
he.
But
it
was
not
so.
But
not
all
of
it?
But
so
is
not
she.
But
was
this
the…
But
were
they
not?
But
what
about
me?
But
what
are
they?
But
what
do
we
do?
But
what
is
this…
But
what
said
she?
But
what
was
that?
But
who
are
these?
But
who
can
he
be?
But
who
were
they?
But
you
have
time.
Can
this
be,
then?
Did
you
know
her?'
Did
you
know
this?
Do
they,
do
they!'
Do
you
know
them?'
Do
you
not
see
it?
Do
you
see
it
now?
Has
he
been
good?'
Have
you
time
now?
He
all
but
had
me.
He
did
as
he
said.
He
did
not
see
me.
He
would
be
there.
It
is
all
for
you.
It
is
very
little.
It
is
you,
is
it?'
It
is,
was
in
him.
It
must
not
be
so.
It
was
as
he
said.
It
will,
it
will.'
Know
man
from
man?
No
man
must
know.'
No
more
than
that.
No
more
than
this?
No
more,
no
more!'
No,
but
have
you?'
No,
he
has
no
one.
No,
he
is
no
more!
No,
not
like
that.
No,
would
she
did.
Not
good,
said
he.
Not
with
a
woman?'
Not,
is;
but,
was.
Now
is
their
time.
Now,
in
good
time!
Now,
who
is
that?'
Of
that
by
and
by.
One
must
know
her.
Only
for
a
little.
Or
is
it
from
her?
Our
will
was
good.
See
there,
there!'
See
you
these
men?
So
down
with
them!
So
have
your
will!
So
it
is
with
man.
So
it
is
with
you.
So
it
was
with
me.
So
much
for
that!'
So
she
had
it
on…
So
we
must
all
be!
So,
with
this
man.
Such
a
good
woman!
That
has
been
it.'
That
is
all
of
it.
That
is
the
first.
That
was
like
him.
The
other
is
this.
There
is,
he
said.
There
you
are
out.
They
all
know
him.
They
do
not
know!'
They
said
no
more.
They
said,
It
was.
They
will
have
it!
This
is
it,
is
it?
This
would
be
she.
This
would
not
do.
Up
with
him,
then!
Was
she
so
at
all?
We
have
the
other.
We
may
have
been!'
Were
they
his
men?
What
a
man
it
is!'
What
are
we
to
do?
What
are
you
now?'
What
can
that
be?'
What
can
you
know?
What
could
she
do?
What
could
you
do?
What
did
he
there?
What
did
she
have?
What
did
she
know?
What
did
they
see?
What
did
which
do?
What
did
you
see?'
What
is
all
this!'
What
is
all
this?'
What
is
it
to
her?
What
is
it,
then?'
What
is
she
to
us?
What
is
your
will?
What
it
was
like?'
What
man
is
this?'
What
more
of
him?'
What
should
he
be?
What
should
he
do!
What
should
he
do?
What
should
it
be?
What
should
we
do?
What
then
is
time?
What
time
is
that?
What
was
he
to
do?
What
was
he,
then?
What
was
in
there?
What
was
it,
then?
What
was
my
first?
What
was
she
like?
What
was
that
for?
What
was
the
good?
What
was
the
time?
What
we
have
been.
What
will
be
said?
What
will
she
do?'
What

that
be?
What
will
this
do?
What
will
you
do?'
What
would
he
be?'
What
would
she
do?
What
would
you
do?
What,
have
you
it?
What,
is
this
all?
What,
then,
to
do?
What,
then,
what?'
Which
do
you
know?
Which
is
it
to
be?
Who
are
they
from?
Who
are
you,
then?
Who
is
that
there?
Who
is
the
woman?'
Who
was
with
you?'
Who-who-can
it
be?
Will
you
have
her?
Will
you
have
it?'
Woman,
what
is
it?
Would
she
like
it?
Would
you
like
it?
You
are
very
good!
You
are
very
good.
You
are,
are
you?'
You
do
not
see
it?
You
have
it
there.
You
have
said
now.
You
know
it
then?'
You
know
that
one?
You
know
you
have.
You
know
you
were!
You
must
know
all!
You
must
know
now.
You
said
not
this?
You
will
do
that?'
You
will
not
then?
You
will
see
him.'
You
would
be
you!'
You
would--no,
no!
'But
they
know
me.
'What
is
it,
now?'
"A
man
or
a
woman?"
"All
in
good
time."
"And
all
for
what?"
"And
by
one
other."
"And
that
was
all?"
"And
what
are
you?"
"And
what
is
that?"
"And
what
is
this?"

what
of
that?"

who
are
they?"

who
was
that?"

you
know
him?"

one
with
you?"
"Before,
or
after?"
"But
have
we
time?"
"But
not
with
you?"
"But
on
what
then?"
"But
that
is
over."
"But
that
was
all."

you
not
one?"

said
he
would."
"He
was
the
first?"
"He
will,
He
will."
"If
that
were
all!"

he
a
good
man?"
"It
is
not
for
me."

you
of
them?"
"Like
to
know
her?"
"May
a
woman
know?"
"No
--
not
at
all."
"No,
you
must
not."
"Now
then,
my
man!"
"Now
what
is
this?"
"Now
you
know
all."
"Now,
is
that
all?"

out
upon
it!"

is
there
now."
"Out
with
it,
man!"
"Then
have
at
you!"
"Then
what
was
it?"
"Then
who
are
you?"
"Then
you
know
me?"
"They
do,
do
they?"
"They
do,
you
see."
"Was
it
all
there?"
"We
are
one,
then."
"We
are
there
now."
"We
must
have
him!"
"What
are
you
for?"
"What
can
this
be?"
"What
can
you
see?"
"What
did
you
see?"
"What
do
you
know?"
"What
do
you
like?"
"What
is
all
this?"
"What
is
he
after?"
"What
is
he,
then?"
"What
is
it
about?"
"What
is
it
to
be?"
"What
is
it,
then?"
"What
is
not
that?"
"What
is
she
like?"
"What
is
that
for?"
"What
is
the
good?"
"What
is
the
time?"
"What
is
this
for?"
"What
man
is
that?"
"What
may
that
be?"
"What
may
they
be?"
"What
time
was
it?"
"What
was
he
like?"
"What
was
it
like?"
"What
was
it
then?"
"What
will
you
do?"
"What
would
he
do?"
"Which
of
the
two?"
"Who
are
they
not?"
"Who
are
with
him?"
"Who
is
the
other?"
"Who
said
you
had?"
"Who
was
it,
then?"
"Who
was
that
man?"
"Will
that
be
all?"
"Will
you
do
that?"
"Would
he
do
that?"
"You
can,
can
you?"
"You
did,
did
you?"
"You
have
said
it."
"You
know
it
then?"
"You
know
you
are!"
"You
will
have
to."
'And
what
is
that?'
'What
is
it,
then?'
--
No
more
of
this.
--
This,
as
it
may!
--
We
had
not
then.
A
little
at
a
time.
A
woman
and
a
man…
And
he
is
with
her?
And
is
it
not
one?'
And
more
than
that!
And
more
than
that.
And
she
will
do
it.
And
what
are
these?
And
what
if
he
did!
And
what
if
he
had?
And
what
was
that?'
But
could
it
be
so?
But
do
not
know
me.
But
it
is
not
that.
But
it
may;
it
may.
But
it
will
not
do.
But
more
than
this.
But
not
before
the.
But
there
they
are.
But
there
will
be.'
But
they
could
not!
But
this
is
not
so.
But
this
was
after.
But
we
can
do
more.
But
what
about
you?
But
what
can
we
do?
But
what
were
they?
But
when
they
did…
But
will
you,
then?
By
and
by
you
may…
Can
it
be
all
over?
Did
they
know
her?'
Do
they
not
see
me?
Do
you
know
of
any?
Do
you
not
know
me?
Do
you
not
like
it?
Do
you
see
her
now?
Down,
down
with
it!
For
a
woman--what?'
For
no
good,
then.'
Good
man,
good
man.
Have
at
them
there.
Have
they
any
will?
Have
you
some
time?
He
could
not
do
it.
He
did
not
like
it.
He
may,
or
may
not.
He
must
be
good
...
He
must
not
see
me.
Him
who
is
no
more.
Is
it
all
over
now?
Is
that
the
woman?'
It
did
at
the
time.
It
is
for
his
good.
It
is
not
like
her.
It
may
all
be
over!
It
would
have
been.
Know
man,
from
man?
Know
one,
know
all.
Know
you
these
two?
May
we
not
see
him?
No
more
about
that.
No,
as
to
that,
no.
No,
it
must
be
now.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no!
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
No,
no,
not
at
all.
No--the
one
to
you.
No--what
should
he?
No;
it
is
not
good.
Now
he
was
upon
it.
Now,
now,
now,
now.
Now,
what
are
they?
On,
on,
on,
on,
on!
Only
two
there
now.
She
did
and
he
did.
She
is
good
to
me.'
So
be
it--so
be
it.
So
it
was
all
over.
Such
a
one
is
this.
That
was
not
to
be.
That
was
very
good!
The
will,
the
will!
Then
there
they
be.
Then
there
you
are!
Then
what
are
they?
There
are
who
have.
There
is,
there
is.
There
was
no
other.
There
you
have
him.
They
all
know
that.
This
much
you
know.
This
should
not
be.
This
was
not
to
be.
To
be
or
not
to
be.
To
have
her,
or
no.
To
the
first,
then.
Very
good,
he
said.
What
Woman
is
this?
What
an
if
you
do?'
What
and
if
you
do?
What
are
they
like?
What
are
we
to
do?'
What
are
we
up
to?'
What
are
you
about?
What
are
you
there?
What
are
you
to
do?
What
are
you
up
to?
What
could
they
do?
What
good
are
they?
What
have
we
there?
What
have
we
to
do?
What
is
it
to
you?'
What
is
it
you
see?
What
is
that
other?
What
is
that
to
me?
What
is
this,
then?
What
is
to
be
said!
What
is
to
be
said?
What
should
she
do?
What
was
she
to
do?
What
were
they
all?
What
were
we
to
do?
What
will
you
have?
What
woman
is
this?
When
will
what
be?'
Which
should
it
be?
Who
are
they
then?'
Who
should
that
be?
Who
was
the
other?'
Who
was
this
woman?
Who
will
be
there?'
Who,
then,
are
you?
Woman
that
you
are!
Would
you
have
me?'
You
are
very
good!'
You
do
not
know
it?
You
do
not
know
me?
You
had
to
see
me?'
You
have
been
to--?
You
know
me
little.
You
must
not
do
it!
You
must
not
do
it.
You
were
with
him?'
'Would
you
like
to?
"All
but
these
two."
"And
are
they
good?"
"And
if
he
has
one?"
"And
over
there?..."
"And
the
other
one?"
"And
was
he
not
so?"
"And
what
are
they?"
"And
what
was
that?"
"And
when
was
that?"
"And
which
is
that?"
"And
you
have
them?"
"Any
time
you
like."
"Are
they
not
good?"
"But
not
about
all?"
"But
you
will
have."
"Could
you
do
that?"
"Did
you
know
that?"
"Did
you
know
them?"
"Do
you
not
see
us?"
"Good
little
woman!"
"Had
it
much
in
it?"
"Have
they
but
one?"
"Have
you
been
out?"
"If
he
has
not
any?"
"If
there
was
time."
"Is
it
as
good
now?"
"Is
that
all,
then?"
"Is
there
only
one?"
"It
can
only
be
he!"
"It
is
there,
then?"
"It
will
be
to
you."
"May
we
see
it
now?"
"No--what
about
it?"
"Now,
was
he
there?"
"Said
in
good
time!"
"So
it
was
a
woman?"
"That
you
will
see."
"Then
it
is
for
me!"
"Then
you
know
him?"
"There
is
no
other."
"There
you
have
it."
"There,
do
you
see?"
"This
is
your
time!"
"To
her
and
to
you!"
"Was
it
a
good
one?"
"We
must
not
do
so?"
"What
are
we
to
do?"
"What
are
you
then?"
"What
can
a
man
do?"
"What
did
she
know?"
"What
is
all
this?…
"What
is
it,
a
man?"
"What
is
that
time?"
"What
like
was
she?"
"What
time
are
you?"
"What
was
it
about?"
"What
was
she
like?"
"What
was
that
for?"
"What
was
that
man?"
"What
will
they
be?"
"What
will
they
do?"
"What
would
you
do?"
"What,
for
me
only?"
"What,
then,
is
it?"
"When
there
is
any."
"Which
of
us
is
it?"
"Which
you
are
not."
"Who
are
these
men?"
"Who
are
you,
then?"
"Who
is
that
woman?"
"Who
may
it
be
for?"
"Who
was
the
first?"
"Who
was
the
other?"
"Would
you
like
it?"
"Would
you
like
to?"
"You
are
very
good."
"You
know
him
then?"
"You
know
me,
then?"
"You
must
be
great."
"You
must
have
one."
"You--all
the
time?"
'And
what
about
her?
'What
are
we
to
do?'
--
Do
you
know
what?
--What
time
is
that?
;
"No,
she
did
not!"
All
is
one
for
that.
And
so
on
and
so
on.
And
that
is
not
all.
And
the
man
is
good.
And
then---and
then!
And
they
were
these.
And
what
about
men?'
And
what
after
that?
And
what
can
one
do?
And
what
did
she
do?
And
what
was
it
for?
As
much
as
you
will.
But
do
you
like
her?
But
it
would
not
do.
But
no
more
of
this.
But
that
is
not
all.
But
that
may
not
be.
But
this
is
not
all.
But
we
must
do
more.
But
what
can
we
do?'
But
what
did
men
do?
But
what
must
we
do?
But
who
is
with
him?
But
would
it
be
so?'
Do
that
if
you
can.'
Do
you
know
of
one?'
Do
you
not
know
him?
Do
you
see
her
now?'
Do
you
see
that
now!
First,
we
have
time.
He
could
not
see
it.
He
had
some
with
me.
He
must
not
see
her.
He
said
that
he
had.
If
not
from
the
man.
It
can
only
be
that!
It
is
all
one
to
me.
It
is
all
with
her!'
It
is
not
he,
is
it?
It
may
do
some
good.
It
was
you,
was
it?'
It
will
do
you
good.
Know
you
not
he
has?
Know
you
this
woman?
My
what--my
what--?'
No,
it
could
not
be.
No,
she
was
in
time!
Now
then,
now
then!'
Only
to
you,
to
you!
Out
of
it
out
of
it.
She
could
do
little.
She
did
not
know
it.
She
is
in
up
there?'
She
was
little
more.
She
will
be
no
more.
So
he
was
not
there?
That
is
it,
you
see.
That
will
do
for
us.
The
man
said
he
was.
There
is
more
to
do.
There
is
much
to
do.
There
they
all
were.
There
will
be
such…
There,
there,
there!
They
know,
you
know.
They
were
all
there.
They
were
not
of
us.
They
were
two
women.
They
would
have
me.'
This
is
all,
is
it?'
This
is
such
a
time.
To
be,
or
not
to
be!
We
do
not
do
it
now.
We
had
a
great
time.
We
have
been
there.'
We
know
it
will
not.
What
are
they
then?'
What
are
they
to
do?
What
are
they
to
me!
What
are
they
to
me?
What
are
you
to
her?
What
have
you
there?
What
is
about
to
be?
What
is
it
to
me?...
What
is
there
in
it?
What
is
there
to
do?
What
made
you
do
it?
What
should
be
said?
What
should
they
do?
What
should
this
be?
What
was
it
you
...?
What
were
they
now?'
What
were
you
about?
What
would
men
have?
What
would
she
have?
What
would
this
man?
What
would
you
have?
What
would
you
more?
What,
can
there
not?
Which
one
of
us
has?
Who
can
it
be,
then?
Who
can
that
man
be?
Would
he
be
in
time?
You
did
not
see
her?
You
had
it
from
her.
You
know
him,
then?'
You
know
who
we
are!
'Who
were
you
then?'
"All
over,
all
over!"
"And
he
did--he
did!"
"And
now,
and
now--!"
"And
that
will
be--?"
"And
what
about
her?"
"And
what
about
him?"
"And
what
did
he
do?"
"And
what
may
it
be?"
"And
which
is
which?"
"And
who
is
is
this?"
"And
who
is
the
man?"
"And
who
may
you
be?"
"Are
you
there,
now?"
"But
all
are
not
so."
"But
what
can
he
do?"
"But
what
did
we
do?"
"But
will
he
see
it?"
"Can
it
do
any
good?"
"Can
you
be
with
us?"
"Did
you
not
see
it?"
"Did
you
see
it
all?"
"Did
you
see
no
one?"
"Do
you
not
know
it?"
"Do
you
not
see
him?"
"From
you--from
you!"
"He
is
the
only
one."
"He
was
one
of
them."
"Is
he
not
with
you?"
"Is
that
good
of
me?"
"It
is
he,
it
is
he!"
"It
is
there,
there!"
"It
will
do
me
good."
"Men
will
see
to
it."
"Not
more
than
that?"
"Not
very--a
little."
"Now
do
you
know
me?"
"Now
then,
now
then!"
"Only
two
at
a
time?"
"She
must
have
been."
"So
be
it;
so
be
it."
"So
it
must
be
then!"
"The
woman
is
in
me."
"Then
it
must
be
so!"
"Then
there
you
are!"
"Then
there
you
are."
"These
will
be
good!"
"They
are
after
you."
"Was
he
good
to
you?"
"We
are
now
but
two."
"What
are
they
then?"
"What
are
you
about?"
"What
are
you
to
do?"
"What
are
you
up
to?"
"What
for
this
time?"
"What
good
are
they?"
"What
have
we
to
do?"
"What
have
you
said?"
"What
is
it
all
for?"
"What
is
it
made
of?"
"What
is
it,
my
man?"
"What
is
that
to
me!"
"What
is
that
to
me?"
"What
is
there
more?"
"What
time
was
that?"
"What
was
it
he
did?"
"What,
what
is
this?"
"What--you
know
him?"
"When
can
you
do
so?"
"When
will
he
be
in?"
"Who
are
you
at
all?"
"Who
could
there
be?"
"Who
did
that
there?"
"Who
would
these
be?"
"You
are
good
to
me."
"You
do
not
know
me."
"You
do
not
like
me?"
"You
know
him,
then?"
"You
see
what
he
is!"
'But
this
is
not
all.
,
Made
a
very
great…
--"She
must
like
it."
--"What
man
is
that?"
After
her,
after
her.
And
did
you
see
him?'
And
if
not
now,
when?
And
if
so
what
is
it?
And
she--as
for
her!'
And
so
on,
and
so
on.
And
so
said
they
all.
And
what
did
you
do?'
And
what
do
you
know?
And
what
if
they
are?
And
what
is
he
to
do?
And
what
may
that
be?
And
what
may
they
be?
And
what
of
all
this?
And
you--who
are
you?
But
do
you
know
them?
But
he
was
not
there.
But
it
may
not
be
so.
But
it
was
not
to
be.
But
that
was
not
all.
But
they
know
it
not!
But
this
was
not
all.
But
what
could
he
do?
But
what
could
we
do?
But
what
if
there
is?
But
what
will
you
do?
But
you
will
see
him.
Could
he
have
had
it?
Did
they
but
know
it!
Do
you
see
this
man?'
For
him
then
not
for.
For
some
time,
is
it?
For
they
all
had
her.
He
could
not
do
that.
He
could
not
miss
it.
He
did
not
know
them.
He
did
what
he
could.
He
is
good
to
women.'
He
said
he
could
not.
He
said
no
more
then.
If
he
did,
what
then?
Is
it
for
us
to
see?'
Is
there
more
of
it?'
It
is
more
than
that.
It
may
be,
it
may
be!
It
must
be
as
it
may.
It
must
be--it
is
he.
It
was
not
so
at
all!
It
was
not
so
at
all.
It
was
so
with
these.
It
will
do
some
good.
It
would
not
be
good.
Know
what
they
would?
No
more
of
it
for
me!
No
one
has
said
that.
Now
then,
what
is
it?
Now,
could
she
do
it?
Now,
then,
you
there!
One
of
you--only
one.
Only
if
this
must
be!
See
her,
if
you
must.
See
him,
miss,
first.
She
did
not
know
him.
She
was
a
good
woman.
That
it
would
not
do.
That
was
one
for
him.
That
was
what
it
was.
The
other
was
for
us.
Then
they
were
on
me.
Then
what
do
they
do?
There
are
such
women.
There
are,
are
there?
There
he
is,
you
see!
There
it
is,
you
see.
There
was
more
of
it.
There,
there,
he
was.
They
did
not
see
it…
They
have,
they
have.
They
were,
they
said.
This
is
all
there
is.
This
is
what
she
did.
This
man
was
the
man.
This
time
it
is
an
A.
This
was
one
of
them.
To
me,
to
you,
to
us!
Very
good,
very
good!
Very
like,
very
like.
Very
much,
very
much.
Was
it
good
for
you?'
Was
there
no
one
by?'
Was
there
such
a
man?
We
can
do
as
we
like.
We
do
more
than
that.
We
have
and
they
are.
We
see
it,
we
see
it.
We
will
see
about
it.
What
a
time
was
this!
What
a
woman
are
you!
What
a
woman
are
you?
What
are
they
to
me?'
What
are
they
to
you?
What
are
you
made
of?
What
can
it
be,
then?
What
did
he
do
there?
What
did
you
do
then?
What
do
they
do
then?
What
has
he
made
you?
What
have
you
there?'
What
is
it
after
all?
What
is
it
all
about?
What
is
she
like
now?
What
is
the
time
now?
What
is
there
for
us?
What
is
there
in
her?
What
is
this
she
was?
What
it
was
at
first.
What
more
can
he
do?'
What
were
they
about?
What
would
they
have?
What
you
said,
is
it?
When
did
you
see
him?
When
he
has
only
one.
Which
of
these
is
he?
Who
will
we
do
it
on?
You
are
such
a
woman!
You
know
he
has
not.'
You
know
he
was
not.'
You
know
what
he
is!'
You
may
be
the
woman.
You
should
know
her.'
You
will
see
me
then.
'To
you,
very
little.
'You
see
what
it
is?'
"'Such
as
they
were'?"
"And
do
they
know
it?"
"And
do
you
like
her?"
"And
now
you
see
her?"
"And
so
they
must
be!"
"And
then
-
and
then?"
"And
what
did
you
do?"
"And
what
other
time?"
"And
who
is
this
man?"
"But
it
was
some
one."
"But
not
much,
is
it?"
"But
that
is
not
all."
"But
what
did
she
do?"
"But
who
will
she
be?"
"But
who
would
do
it?"
"But
you
know
it
now."
"By-and-by,
you
know."
"Could
you
do
it
now?"
"Do
you
know
his
man?"
"From
him
to
any
one."
"Have
you
been
there?"
"He
did
that,
did
he?"
"He
must
not
see
him."
"He
said
you
were
to."
"Is
it
all
over
then?"
"Is
there
more,
then?"
"Is
there
over
there?"
"It
is
for
you
or
me!"
"No,
he
is
not
there."
"No,
that
is
not
all!"
"So
then
all
is
over."
"Some
one
will
be
by."
"Than
any
one
at
all."
"Than
any
one
at
all?"
"That
is
very
little."
"That
is
what
he
did."
"Then
what
is
it
for?"
"Then
what
may
it
be?"
"There
can
be
no
one!"
"They
made
you
do
it!"
"This
is
as
you
were."
"What
about
me,
then?"
"What
are
they
about?"
"What
are
you
in
for?"
"What
do
you
do
then?"
"What
have
you
there?"
"What
is
he
good
for?"
"What
is
that
to
you?"
"What
is
there
to
do?"
"What
made
you
do
it?"
"What
more
can
we
do?"
"What
time
is
it
now?"
"What
were
they
like?"
"What
will
he
do
now?"
"What
would
you
have?"
"What
would
you
like?"
"What
would
you
more?"
"What,
all
that
time?"
"When
will
she
be
in?"
"Will
you
be
so
good?"
"Would
that
we
could!"
"Would
you
like
that?"
"You
are
not
a
woman."
"You
do
not
know
him?"
"You
had
it
from
him."
"You
have
made
it
up?"
"You
know
about
that?"
"You
like
them,
then?"
--And
have
it
she
did.
--What
have
you
there?
:
What
will
he
do
now?
All
men
should
do
so.'
All
of
us
can
do
that.
And
could
she
see
him?
And
so
are
like
to
do.
And
so
it
is
with
us.'
And
the
other
is
not?'
And
this
she
could
do.
And
what
could
she
do?
And
what
did
they
see?
And
what
may
that
be?'
And
what
said
he
then?
And
would
that
be
all?
Any
one
would
do
that.
Are
all
men
like
this?
But
he
did
not
see
it.
But
no,
no,
he
must...
But
we
do
not
know
it.
But
what
are
we
to
do?
But
what
can
you
do?"'
But
what
could
she
do?
But
what
is
one
to
do?
But
what
should
he
do?
But
what
was
he
to
do?
But
what
was
it
to
be?
But
what
was
the
good?
But
who
are
all
these?
By-and-by,
by-and-by.'
Can
they
be
after
me?'
Could
he
have
said
it?
Did
you
not
know
that?
Did
you
see
me
at
all?
Do
they
know
about
it?
Do
you
know
him,
then?
Do
you
know
it
or
not?
Good;
and
what
of
him?
He
has
been
to
see
us.
He
is
very
good
to
me.
He
said
that
would
do.
He
said
to
him:
Which?
He
will
be
good
to
us!
If
he
were
only
that!'
Is
this
all
they
have?
It
is
as
it
should
be.
It
must
be
as
it
will!
May
have
been
or
not.'
Men
are
not
like
that.
No
more
than
you
have.
No
one
is
to
be
there.
No
one
would
have
her.
No,
he
could
not
know!
No,
no;
she
could
not.
No,
no;
what
if
he
be?
No,
that
could
not
be.
No,
that
would
not
do.
Not
when
you
know
all.
She
did
not
know--now.
She
had
so
much
to
do!
She
will
do
it
for
me.
She
will
not
see
him?'
That
is
good,
he
said.
That
is,
she
had
been.
That
they
do
not
know.
That
was
what
he
said.
That
will
do,
he
said.
Then
have
it,
have
it.
Then
what
do
you
see?'
There
are
no
more
men.
There
are
two
of
them!
There
is
first
for
me.
There
is
not,
he
said.
There,
do
as
you
like.
These
before
the
time.
They
will
not
do
that.
They
will
see
to
that.
We
had
not
much
to
do.
We
know
all
about
it.'
We
know
they
will
not.
We
should
not
do
that.
What
are
we
to
do
now?
What
can
it
be,
then?'
What
can
the
time
be?'
What
could
we
do
then?
What
did
we
do
to
her?
What
did
you
do,
then?
What
do
you
see
in
it?
What
good
would
it
do?
What
must
be,
must
be.
What
should
he
do
now?
What
then,
do
you
see?
What
was
he
there
for?
What
was
he
to
do
now?
What
will
be,
will
be.
What
would
have
me
do?
What
would
he
do
then?
What
would
it
be
like?
What,
you
do
not
know!
When
did
you
see
him?'
Who
and
what
are
they?
Who
could
you
be,
now?
Who
said
it
was,
man?'
Who
will
these
men
be?
Will
you
have
it
now?'
Would
that
do
it
good?
Would
you
like
to
see?
You
are
all
like
this.
You
know
they
are
not.
You
know
what
you
are.
You
may
not,
you
know.
You
would,
would
you?'
'What
to
do
with
him?'
"All
is
not
then
over?"
"And
that
was
like
me!"
"And
what
can
they
be?"
"And
what
did
you
see?"
"And
what
do
you
know?"
"And
what
if
they
are?"
"And
what
is
it
to
be?"
"And
what
is
it
to
me?"
"And
what
may
that
be?"
"And
what
will
you
do?"
"And
who
was
that
man?"
"As
what,
then,
is
he?"
"But
it
was
not
to
be."
"But
what
about
women?"
"But
what
could
it
be?"
"But
what
is
it,
then?"
"But
what
will
you
do?"
"But
who
are
you
then?"
"Did
any
other
see
me?"
"Did
any
see
it
after?"
"Did
you
see
all
that?"
"Did
you
see
him
then?"
"Did
you
see
that
one?"
"Do
you
know
that
man?"
"Is
it
that
you
can--?"
"Is
that
what
you
did?"
"It
is
all
over,
then?"
"It
is
all
up
with
us."
"It
is
so,
little
one."
"It
was
he,
it
was
he!"
"It
would
be
like
him."
"Not
any
more
of
this!"
"Not
at
all
as
before."
"Not
to
me,
not
to
me!"
"Now
you
know
you
did."
"Now,
what
can
you
do?"
"See
what
may
be
said!"
"Some
other
man,
then?"
"That
it
is
not
there."
"That
was
a
good
time."
"Was
that
all
he
said?"
"We
must
see
about
it."
"Were
you
there,
then?"
"What
can
it
be,
then?"
"What
can
we
do,
then?"
"What
can
you
do
then?"
"What
did
he
do,
then?"
"What
did
she
do
then?"
"What
did
you
do
then?"
"What
good
will
it
do?"
"What
is
he
after
now?"
"What
is
it
all
about?"
"What
is
there
to
see?"
"What
then
did
you
do?"
"What
was
there
in
it?"
"What,
it
was
not
you?"
"When
did
she
do
that?"
"When
did
you
see
her?"
"Who
and
what
are
you?"
"Would
you
be
so
good?"
"You
are
a
good
woman."
"You
have
--
have
you?"
"You
know
which
it
is?"
"You
know
who
that
is?"
"You
will
not
do
that?"
"You
will
not
see
her?"
"You
will
not
see
him."
'"What
was
that,
then?"
--"What
are
you,
then?"
--"Will
she
like
that?"
--She
said
it,
we
know.
--What
a
time
you
were!
.That
is,
a
little
one.
All
is
as
it
should
be.
And
what
could
that
be?
And
what
if
you
should?
And
who
was
the
other?'
Are
there
any
good
men?
Before
the
time
be
out!
Before
the
time
be
out?
But
he
could
not
do
it.
But
he
did
not
know
it.
But
it
is
all
over
now.
But
it
is
not
for
that.
But
it
would
not
do
so.
But
now
he
has
made
it.
But
that
time
was
over.
But
that
was
not
to
be.
But
what
is
that
to
me?
But
what
was
she
to
do?
Could
he
but
know
that!
Did
they
but
know
this!
Do
you
know
what
it
is?
Do
you
not
know
women?'
From
her
to
that
woman!
Have
you
not
much
more?
He
could
not
have
said.
He
would
not
do
it--no!
If
you
are
two
to
one?'
If
you
could
have
her?'
If
you
will
be
so
good.
If
you
will
only
do
it!
It
must
be
one
of
them.
It
was
you,
was
it
not?
Like
this,
it
was
good.
Must
it
be
he--he
only?
No,
no;
they
would
not.
No,
you
do
not,
do
you?
No;
it
is
not
with
her.
Not
at
all,
not
at
all!
Not
at
all,
not
at
all.
Not
you,
or
any
of
you.
Now,
then,
there
he
is!
She
had
not
been
there.
She
has
no
one,
no
one.
She
may
or
she
may
not.
She
should
be
with
me.'
That
is
what
he
is
for.
That
may
or
may
not
be.
That
time
or
any
other.
That
was
very
good
now.
There
are
some
of
them.
There
are
women--women!
There
was
no
one
in
it.
There
was
no
one
there.
There
were
two
of
them.
There
you
are,
you
see!
There
you
have
the
man!
They
said:
We
know
him.
They
would
not
know
me.
This
is
about
the
time.
This
is
not
who
we
are.
This
time
it
is
for
me.
Time
that
it
should
be!
Very
good;
and
what
is.
We
know
all
about
that!
We
know
what
women
are.
What
can
she
have
said?
What
can
we
do
for
him?
What
can
we
do
for
you.
What
can
we
do
for
you?
What
could
it
be,
then?
What
did
she
see
there?
What
did
you
do
it
for?
What
do
you
know
of
it?
What
is
to
be,
will
be!
What
then,
will
you
do?
What
was
it
all
about?'
What
will
be
-
will
be.
What
will
he
do
for
us?
What
would
he
do,
then?
What
would
you
with
me?
What
would
you
with
us?
What,
then,
do
you
see?
When
will
you
see
her?'
Who
can
do
good
on
him?
With
me
this
is
not
so.
With
this
first
of
all.
Women,
you
know,
women.
You
know
this
man
then!
You
like
this,
do
you?'
You
may
see
what
it
is.
You
were
you,
you
know.
"'That
is
all
over
now!"
"And
if
so,
what
is
it?"
"And
that
woman
is
you."
"And
the
women
do
this?"
"And
what
is
it
to
you?"
"And
what
was
she
like?"
"And
what
would
you
do?"
"And
when
will
that
be?"
"And
who
is
this
woman?"
"And
who
was
the
first?"
"Any
woman
could
do
it."
"Are
they
little,
then?"
"But
she
was
not
there!"
"But
there
is
only
one!"
"But
what
are
we
to
do?"
"But
what
would
you
do?"
"But
when
will
that
be?"
"But
who
are
you,
then?"
"But,
what
will
you
do?"
"Did
you
know
about
it?"
"Do
you
know
any
other?"
"Do
you
know
him,
then?"
"Do
you
like
me
at
all?"
"Do
you
see
them,
then?"
"Have
you
it
about
you?"
"He
should
have
been--?"
"It
is
not
that
at
all!"
"Man,
is
he
man
at
all?"
"Now
what
are
we
to
do?"
"Now,
if
you
have
them."
"So,
then,
all
is
over."
"That
is
so,
is
it
not?"
"The
one
that
you
have?"
"Very
good,
what
is
it?"
"Were
they
good
to
you?"
"What
a
good
man
he
is!"
"What
did
he
do
it
for?"
"What
did
he
do
to
you?"
"What
did
you
do,
then?"
"What
do
you
see
there?"
"What
good
can
that
do?"
"What
is
she
there
for?"
"What
is
there
in
them?"
"What
must
be,
will
be."
"What
then
do
you
know?"
"What
time
is
it,
then?"
"What
was
it
all
about?"
"What
will
you
do
then?"
"When
will
you
do
that?"
"Who
is
with
him,
then?"
"Who
was
that
with
you?"
"Will
you
do
that
much?"
"You
know
what
that
is?"
--Now,
my
miss,
he
said.
--There
he
is,
she
said.
About
you,
not
about
me.
After
it,
not
out
of
it.
And
now
no
more
of
this.
And
now
what
will
we
do?
And
there
is
made--what?
And
to,
it
is
before
us.
And
what
if
it
were
she!
And,
of
all
women,
you!'
Any
time
will
do
for
me.
But
if
it
is
not
so----.
But
it
was
good
for
her.
But
it
was
not
all
over.
But
she
could
not
do
so.
But
she
would
not
do
so.
But
that
is
what
he
did!
But
they
did
not
see
it.
But
they
little
know
me!
But
this
is
not
the
man.
But
what
are
they
to
do?
But
what
good
did
it
do!
But
what
would
you
have?
But
will
you--could
you?
Do
you
know
what
it
was?
Do
you
know
who
she
was?
Have
you
a
man
for
that?
He
was
not
as
other
men.
He
was
there
for
a
time.
He
would
not
have
it
so.
If
he
did
but
know
what?
Much
good
may
it
do
you!
No
more
of
her
and
hers!
No;
have
you
such
a
one?
On
and
on
and
on
and
on!
She
is
all
in
all
to
me.
So
this
was
what
he
did.
There
was
not
much
said.
They
did
as
he
had
said.
They
were
all
very
good.
They
were
not
all
there.
They
would
be
after
him.
This
is
as
it
should
be.
This
we
can
and
must
do.
Was
it
at
all
like
this?
We
must
see
about
that.'
What
can
be
said
for
it.
What
did
he
do
for
you?'
What
do
they
do
to
him?'
What
do
you
know
of
him?
What
good
do
they
do
us?
What
good
would
that
do?
What
has
she
said
of
me?
What
he
could
do
he
did.
What
he
is
now,
you
see.
What
if
it
should
be
so?
What
is
all
this
about?'
What
is
he,
is
with
you?
What
is
it
you
will
see?
What
is
it
you
would
do?
What
is
that,
said
they?
What
more
could
you
do!'
What
more
is
to
be
said?
What
was
it
that
he
did?
What
was
the
good
of
it?
What
will
she
do
there?'
What
would
he
do
to
her?
What
would
you
do
there?
What,
then,
would
he
do?
Which
is
to
be
the
man?'
Will
you
know
them
then?
Women
would
be
with
her.
Would
you
like,
Mr.
---.
You
are
all
women
to
me.
You
know
me,
do
you
not?
You
know
what
women
are.
You
know
you
must
do
it.
You
were,
were
you
not?'
You
will
not
do
it,
you!
'But
what
are
they
for?'
'Who,
and
what
are
you?'
"All
that
she
must
have."
"And
what
did
you
there?"
"And
will
you
do
it
now?"
"Are
you
one
of
his
men?"
"But
what
are
you
up
to?"
"Could
it
have
been
him?"
"Did
it
do
you
any
good?"
"Did
you
or
did
you
not?"
"Do
you
see,
do
you
see!"
"It
was
not
as
she
said?"
"No
more
than
the
other."
"Now,
then,
who
are
you?"
"There
is
no
one
but
me."
"There,
it
is
like
this."
"We
may
know
what
it
is."
"What
are
we
to
do,
now?"
"What
are
you
up
to
now?"
"What
did
you
do
it
for?"
"What
is
all
that
about?"
"What
is
all
this
about?"
"What
is
the
good
of
it?"
"What
man,
and
what
for?"
"What
was
that
you
said?"
"What
will
we
do
at
all?"
"What
will
you
do,
then?"
"What
would
you
do
then?"
"Who
could
it
have
been?"
"Would
you
like
some?..."
"Would
you
like
to
know?"
"You
did;
and
what
then?"
"You
know
that
to
be
so?"
After
us,
not
out
of
us.'
All
now
is
over
with
him.
And
a
woman
is
not
a
man.
And
he
who
can,
will
not!
And
she
can
do
the
other.
And
that
was
for
me
only.
And
what
did
you
do
then?
And
what
would
you
have?'
But
can
you
if
you
would?
But
no,
it
was
not
to
be.
But
what
good
will
it
do?
But
what
is
it
all
about?
But
when
will
it
be
time?
But
you
know--we
are
one.
Did
he
know
them
before?'
Did
she
know
what
it
was?
Do
what
you
like
with
me!
Do
with
me
what
you
will.
Do
you
know
much
of
him?'
Do
you
know
of
any
other?
Do
you
know
what
that
is?
Do
you
know
what
they
do?
Do
you
know
who
that
was?
He
had
been
there
before.
He
had
made
her
so
great.
He
will
not
see
me,
then!
He
will
not
what
he
must!
It
is
in
me--it
is
in
me.
It
was
all
over
with
him.
No
more
of
this,
no
more!
No,
he
could
not
do
that.
Not
when
you
are
with
me?
Out
with
it,
out
with
it!
Some
other
time
for
that.
That
she
will
have
to
do.
Then
what
made
her
do
it?
They
all
said
they
would.
They
do
him
no
good
then.
This
must
be
one
of
them.
What
can
they
do
for
you?
What
have
you
been
about?
What
is
the
good
of
that?
What
was
it--what
was
it?
What
was
there
after
all?
What
would
she
have
now?'
What
would
you
have
more?
Who
is
this
she
was
like?
Would
you
do
what
he
did?
You
do
not
like
it,
then?
You
may
have
it,
you
may!
You
would
see
her
do
it?'
'And
now
which
is
which?'
"A
little;
a
very
little."
"And
if
you
can
do
so
--!"
"And
then
so,
do
you
see?"
"And
then
what
do
you
do?"
"And
what
do
you
do
then?"
"And
what
is
that
to
you?"
"And
you
know
who
she
is?"
"But
what
other
is
there?"
"But
you
know
it
was
not."
"Can
it
or
can
it
not
be?"
"Do
you
know
who
this
is?"
"Has
she
no
one
with
her?"
"It
is
he;
it
must
be
he!"
"It
is
so;
it
must
be
so!"
"No
one
could
be
more
so."
"No,
no,
we
must
have
it!"
"Now,
then,
on
with
them."
"Only
a
little--not
very."
"That
is
what
it
is
like."
"That
is
what
we
will
do."
"This
time
it
must
be
so."
"To
me
you
were,
and
are."
"We
will
see,
as
to
that!"
"What
are
we
to
do,
then?"
"What
are
you
up
to,
now?"
"What
can
they
have
said?"
"What
can
we
do
about
it?"
"What
did
he
do
that
for?"
"What
did
you
do
with
it?"
"What
do
you
know
of
him?"
"What
good
would
that
do?"
"What
would
you
do
to
me?"
"What
would
you
do,
then?"
"Who
could
this
woman
be?"
"You
did
it,
did
you
not?"
"You
know
me,
do
you
not?"
"You
were
with
her,
then?"
--
'And
what
may
that
be?'
--We
can
do
that,
he
said.
And
not
one
of
them
there!
And
now
what
are
we
to
do?
And
such
some
of
you
were.
And
to
what
are
they
like?
And
what
did
you
do
then?'
And
what
more
do
you
see?'
And
what
will
he
do
to
us?
And
you
know
that,
do
you?
And
you--what
did
you
do?'
But
after
all,
what
is
it?
But
can
you,
if
you
would?
But
it
was
not
so,
at
all.
But
that
is
not
all
of
it.
But
there
was
not
of
time.
But
they
could
do
no
more.
But
what
made
her
do
that?
But
what
was
there
to
see?
Can
one
see
from
there?...
Do
you
know
what
a
man
is?
Do
you
see
it--over
there?
Had
there
been
any
before?
He
must
be
made
to
do
it.'
It
would
only
be
like
you.
Must
he
see,
must
he
know?
No,
no
it
could
not
be
so.
Not
at
all,
--
not
at
all.
One
would
like
to
see
her.
She
has
been
there
before.
She
said
she
did
not
know.
She
said,
so
it
should
be.
So
they
were--so
they
are!
That
is
what
we
should
do.
The
time
for
them
is
over.
This
is
the
woman,
is
it?'
What
can
one
do
with
him?'
What
has
it
to
do
with
me?
What
is
it
to
do
with
you?
What
know
you
of
this
man?
What
was
there
to
be
said?
What
will
you
do
with
it?'
What
would
you
have
me
do?
What
would
you
have
us
do?
Will
you
do
it,
by-and-by?
Will
you,
or
will
you
not?
Would
you
like
to
see
him?
You
can
do
it
if
you
like!
You
have
me,
have
you
not?
You
know
what
he
is
like?'
You
know
what
she
is
like.
You
know
what
that
man
is.
You
may
do,
then,
in
time.
You
see
him
there,
do
you?
You
see,
there
was
a
time.
"And
are
the
first
of
men!"
"And
now
that
you
do
know?"
"And
now,
what
must
we
do?"
"And
what
can
we
do
there?"
"And
what
did
she
for
you?"
"And
what
did
you
do
then?"
"And
what
do
the
women
do?"
"And
what
must
we
do
then?"
"And
what
she
said
to
you?"
"And
what
will
she
do
now?"
"And
what
will
we
do
then?"
"But
that
is
now
all
over!"
"But
what
can
they
now
do?"
"But
what
is
it
all
about?"
"Do
with
me
what
you
will."
"Do
you
know
what
that
is?"
"Do
you
know
what
this
is?"
"Do
you
know
who
made
you?"
"Good,
that
is,
very
good."
"Not
at
all
--
not
at
all!"
"Now
what
is
there
in
her?"
"That
is,
if
you
have
any!"
"That
woman
--
that
woman!"
"Then
what
are
they
after?"
"Then
what
are
you
up
now?"
"This
is
very
good
of
you."
"This
woman--who
was
she?…
"What
a
time
they
all
are!"
"What
are
you
about
there?"
"What
did
you
do
that
for?"
"What
is
it
that
you
know?"
"What
more
would
you
have?"
"Which
is
what
she
did
do."
"Who
and
what
is
this
man?"
"Who
are
you,
my
good
man?"
"You
are
the
one
for
that."
"You
know
him,
do
you
not?"
"You
should
have
had
them."
'"What
are
we
to
do,
then?"
...................A
woman.
After
that
it
was
all
over.
And
if
you
should
know
her.
And
then,
he
was
not
there.
And
they
were
good
to
you?'
And
what
are
we
to
do
now?'
And
who
will
do
it
for
me?'
Are
there
any
more
of
them?
But
he
has
not
been
there?'
But
one
has
to
know
him....
But
there
you
have
the
man.
But
what
are
we
to
do
now?'
But,
after
all,
who
is
she?
But,
all
this
was
at
first.
Do
you
not
see
that
after…
He
did
not
know
what
to
do.
He
should
not
have
said
it.
Is
he
all
as
he
should
be?'
It
was
over,
now,
all
over.
No,
he
said,
over
for
good.
Only
when
will
all
that
be?
She
has
more
than
said
it.'
She
must
and
should
be
his.
She
said
she
would
see
her.
That
is
all
there
is
of
it.
That
is
good,
that
is
good.
That
is
what
we
have
to
do.
That
you
may
do
with
women.
The
woman
is
no
good
to
me.
Then
is
it
as
it
should
be.
To
be--that
is,
not
at
all.
We
can
do
this
and
we
must.
What
are
we
to
do
about
it?
What
have
made
you
so
down?
What
was
he
to
do
with
him?
What
would
it
be
to
you?...
What
would
you
have
me
do?'
What,
then,
is
there
to
do?
Who
are
all
these
with
you?
With
me,
what
is
your
will?
Would
you
like
to
see
him?'
You
have
a
man
before
you.]
You
would
like
it
so
much!'
"And
if
they
be,
what
then?"
"And
what
is
he
to
do
then?"
"But
not
so
much
as
you
be."
"But
what
has
that
to
do--?"
"But
you,
what
will
you
do?"
"Do
what
you
will
with
him."
"For
that
is
all
we
can
do."
"Good
for
me,
to
know
this!"
"He
is
a
man--a
man--a
man!"
"No
more,
no
more,
no
more!"
"There
is
no
woman
in
that!"
"There
will
be
more
for
us."
"Was
there
no
one
with
you?"
"We
know
what
we
are
about."
"What
a
good
woman
you
are!"
"What
could
you
do
with
me?"
"What
did
you
do
with
them?"
"What
do
you
know
about
it?"
"What
has
he
to
do
with
it?"
"What
has
to
be,
has
to
be."
"What
should
we
have
to
do?"
"What
will
you
do
up
there?"
"What
would
you
have
me
do?"
"What,
then,
are
we
to
do?…
"Would
you
like
to
see
her?"
"Would
you
like
to
see
him?"
"You
know
what
it
is,
then?"
--What
do
you
know
about
it?
All
this
she
could
not
know.
And
then
what
if
he
did
not?
Be
men,
or
be
more
than
men.
But
is
it
so
with
all
of
us?
But
more
to
me
than
to
you.'
But
she
is
a
woman
of
women!
But
there
is
more
than
that.
But
what
are
we
to
do
there?
But
what
had
we
to
do
there?
But
what
was
he
to
do
there?
But
when
a
woman
like
that…
Do
you
like
her--as
a
woman?
He
may
be
one,
for
all
that.
No,
no,
it
would
do
no
good.
Now,
this
one;
and
this
one.
She
did
not
know
what
to
do.
So
they
may
do
as
they
like.
So
you
will
have
it
with
us.
That
which
must
be,
must
be.
There
he
is,
do
you
see
him?
There
will
be
no
more
of
it.
They
do
to
me,
now
and
then.
What
has
that
to
do
with
it?
What
they
did
may
we
not
do?
What
would
you
like
to
have?
Who
should
do
it
if
not
you?
Would
you
like
to
see
them?'
You
are
the
very
man
for
us.
You
can
do
as
you
have
said.
You
could,
but
you
have
not.
You
said
that
over
and
over.
'And
what
are
they
made
of?'
"And
have
you
been
up
there?"
"And
what
will
you
do
there?"
"But
what
did
you
do
it
for?"
"But
who
could
he
have
been?"
"But
who,
then
was
this
man?"
"But
you
will
see
him,
then?"
"He
must
know
who
are
there."
"No,
but
he
did
not
know
it."
"The
good
--
the
good,
then?"
"Then
you
may
be
so
with
me."
"There
may
be
more
than
one."
"There,
there,
there,
there!"
"This
is
all
we
know
of
her."
"We
have
not
to
do
with
men!"
"What
do
you
know
about
him?"
"What
good
would
that
do
us?"
"What
man
would
for
a
woman?"
"What
was
it
you
said
to
me?"
"What,
you
know
him,
do
you?"
"You
must
not--you
must
not!"
"You
see
that,
you
see
that!"
"You
will
see,
you
will
see."
And
what
good
can
you
do
her?
And
what
good
would
that
do?'
And
what
if
it
was;
if
it
is!
And
what
would
he
do
with
it?
Are
you
there
at
all,
at
all?
But
they
said
to
him:
We
can.
But
what
are
they,
after
all!
But
what
are
you
about
there?
But
what
can
we
do
with
him?'
Down
with
him,
down
with
him!
He
said
he
would,
and
he
had.
Much
more
than
for
any
other.
She
must
and
would
have
them.
She
was
the
only
woman
there.
There
may
have
been
only
one.
Was
much
said
about
it
at--?'
We
were
with
him
at
the
time.
What
has
that
to
do
with
it?'
What
has
that
to
do
with
you?
What
would
you
have
me
to
do?
Will
you
have
any
more
of
it?
You
know
what
you
have
to
do.
You,
and
you
only,
may
do
so.
'What
are
we
to
do
with
him?'
"And
little
time
to
do
it
in!"
"And
what
are
we
to
do,
then?"
"And
what
did
you
do
with
it?"
"And
what
do
you
know
of
him?"
"But
this
time
it
must
be
so."
"Do
you
know
much
about
them?"
"It
could
have
been
no
other."
"Only
now
and
then--a
little."
"There;
and
there;
and
there!"
"What
has
that
to
do
with
it?"
"What
have
you
to
do
with
us?"
"What
was
the
other
man
like?"
"What
will
you
do
after
that?"
"What
would
you
do
with
them?"
"Would
you
like
to
have
some?"
"You
will
see
that
by
and
by."
After
all,
what
good
was
this?
And
is
it
for
that
you
did
it?
And
now
you
know
all
about
us.
And
then
they
do
so
much
good.
And
what
has
he
said
to
that?'
And
what
will
you
do
about
it?
Do
you
know
what
the
time
is?'
Have
they
not
been
before
him?
She
is
not
like
what
she
was.'
She
made
it
out
more
and
more.
Some
of
them
may
see
it
there.
There
is
much,
much
before
us.
There
it
is,
now
-
you
do
not!
This,
then,
is
what
we
can
do.
We
must
know
that
we
may
know.
"And
is
that
all--is
that
all?"
"And
that,
and
that,
and
that!"
"But
there
was
some
one
there?"
"But
what
will
you
do
with
it?"
"But
you
do
not
know
this
man."
"Do
you
know
who
the
other
is?"
"He
said
he
would
not
have
it."
"He
said--he
said
he
was
made."
"She
is
there
with
that
woman."
"Time
is
all
in
all
to
us
now."
"What
did
they
do
it
for
then?"
"What
good
would
she
be
to
us?"
"What
is
the
good
of
all
that?"
"You
must
have
some,
you
know."
"You
see
me
now,
little
woman."
And
have
you
been
good
to
him?'
And
he
did
not
know
what
to
do.
And
now
what
are
we
to
do
now?'
And
what
is
it
when
we
have
it?
And,
after
all,
what
did
he
do?
But
she
was
not
there
any
more.
But
you
will
see,
you
will
see.
Do
you
know
what
you
have
said?
It
will
do
me
good
to
see
her.'
They
are
not
the
men
they
were.
This
was
all
she
said
about
it.
This
was
what
had
to
be,
then…
What
had
it
all
to
do
with
her?
Women
are
to
be
women,
he
said.
Would
there
were
more
like
you!
You
have
to
do
with
that
woman!
"And
what
will
they
do
with
us?"
"But
what
have
they
been
up
to?"
"Can
it
be
that
it
is
all
over?"
"Could
it
have
been
one
of
you?"
"Is
that
all
you
have
with
you?"
"That
is
not
much
good,
is
it?…
"Then
all
will
be
over
with
me."
"They
may
not
be
so
very
great."
"To
see
what
you
said
about
me."
"What
will
be
the
good
of
that?"
"What
will
you
do
with
me
then?"
And
now
they
were
man
and
woman.
And
this
other,
who
is
he
to
be?
And
what
has
that
to
do
with
me?
But
what
are
we
to
do
with
him?'
Did
he
know
what
he
was
made
of?
For
a
time
you
will
not
see
him.
For
it
was
one,
and
a
great
one.
For
some
said:
He
is
a
good
man.
Men
are
men
and
women
are
women.
That
was
all,
and
what
was
that!
That
was
what
he
could
not
know.
Then
what
will
you
do
with
them?
There
could
be
no
other
like
it.
With
her,
on
her,
what
you
will.
"But
then,
what
about
the
other?"
"Do
you
know
what
this
is
to
me?"
"Do
you
know
what
you
have
said?"
"First
of
all,
what
did
you
see?"
"Now
what
are
we
to
do
with
you?"
"One
of
them
or
the
two
of
them?"
"What
would
be
the
good
of
that?"
'What
are
we
to
do
about
it
all?'
And
that
you
would
have
me
to
do?
And
what
have
you
to
do
with
her?
And
what
would
you
have
me
to
do?
And,
if
you
do,
what
is
it
about?
But
there
was
no
time,
after
all.
It
will
do
no
good;
to
you
or
me.
Now
it
was
there,
now
it
was
his.
See,
see:
what
a
man
you
are
now?
See,
see;
what
a
man
you
are
now!
Some
of
them,
when
you
know
them.
Some
other
time,
some
other
time.
That
is
not
like,
said
the
other.
They
were
men:
what
are
they
now?
What
is
it--what
is
it
about
her?
What
more
do
you
know
about
him?'
What
would
you
do
with
him,
now?'
You
had
made
a
will
before
that.'
"And
--
do
--
you
--
like
--
him?"
"That
is
what
they
would
with
us."
"Then
you
have
been
there
before?"
"What
should
there
be
after
that?"
"You
know
not
what
you
are
about."
But
that
has
little
to
do
with
it.
But
what
should
we
have
been
then?
He
did
not
know
what
he
was
about.
He
had
very
little
of
that
in
him.
It
would
be
all
over
with
me
then.
Some
of
us
have
it,
some
have
not.
Then
we
must
have
no
more
of
them.
We
will
have
no
more
of
it
at
all.
What
is
it
to
me
who
you
can
have?
You
see
it:
or,
you
see
he
has
it.
"It
has
more
than
one,
then,
miss?"
"It
will
not
do
--
it
will
not
do!"
"What
could
it
have
to
do
with
me?"
But
there
was
little
for
him
to
do.
But
there
was
more
in
it
than
that.
It
would
have
to
be,
if
it
were
so.
Now
they
must
know
that
he
did
not.
Now
what
would
be
the
good
of
that?
Such
would
be
no
more,
he
had
said.
Then
what
will
you
do
with
me
then?
Very
good;
very
good;
that
will
do.
What
is
she
like,
what
is
she
like?
You
will
not
be
in
time
to
see
her.
"She
will
like
to
see
me,
you
know."
"Would
you
like
him
to
be
with
you?"
And
as
to
the
other,
what
about
him?
Are
there
men--women
and
women--men?
Be
in
time,
be
in
time,
be
in
time!'
"And
it
was
on
that--it
was
on
that!"
"There
was
no
one
like
him
for
that."
They
will
see
that
you
are
not
there.
"If
you
will
not--what
was
she
to
do?"
"You
will
like
her
when
you
know
her."
*"You
must
know
that
this
is
a
woman."
"As
good
as
one
can
have
with
a
woman."
"What
can
you
do
with
a
man
like
that?"
And
by
this
we
know
that
we
are
in
him.
And
that
other
man
is--do
you
know
who?
But
as
for
him--if
it
must
be,
it
must.
But
what
would
you
have
me
do
about
it?
Can
you
not
see
what
it
will
do
for
us?
You
would
have
us
upon
this,
would
you?
'Would
you
like
to
see
a
little
of
it?'
"They
--
did
you
not
see
what
they
did?"
What
it
was
all
about,
she
did
not
know.
"One
would
like
to
know
more
about
this."
"They
may
if
they
like,
but
we
will
not."
But
after
all,
what
would
you
have
me
do?
He
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
miss
you.
That
which
we
will
not
see,
he
could
not.
"But
what
were
you
to
do
with
that
woman?"
And
what
if
there
had
been
some
one
there!
And
would
you
not
do
much
to
do
them
good?
That
was
all
that
could
be
said
about
him.
Do
you
know
who
you
are,
and
what
you
are?'
He
could
not,
or
he
would
not,
we
know
not.
What
was
he
to
do
with
such
a
woman
as
this?
"There
is
some
one
down
there,
is
there
not?"
It
is
but
a
little
before
your
time,
you
know.
This
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
been
there.
Should
they
be--if
these--they
must
be
the
men!
"Your
men
will
know,
then,
what
they
have
to
do?"
And
when
a
man
is
down,
you
know,
what
can
he
do?
"If
it
be
at
all,
it
can
only
be
by
one
of
these."
For
the
man
is
not
of
the
woman:
but
the
woman
of
the
man.
What
are
they,
then,
and
what
have
they
been
in
their
time!
