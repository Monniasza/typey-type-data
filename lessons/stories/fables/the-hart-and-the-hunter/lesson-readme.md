# The Hart and the Hunter

* The `KPA/-T`
* Hart `HA*RT`
* was `WAS`
* once `WUPBS`
* drinking `TKREUG`
* from `TPR`
* a `AEU`
* pool `PAOL`
* and `SKP`
* admiring `AD/PHAOEURG`
* the `-T`
* noble `TPHOEBL`
* figure `TPEUG`
* he `HE`
* made `PHAED`
* there. `THR TP-PL`
* "Ah," `KR-GS KPA/HA*E KW-BG KR-GS`
* said `SAEUD`
* he, `HE KW-BG`
* "where `KR-GS W-R`
* can `K`
* you `U`
* see `SAOE`
* such `SUFP`
* horns `HORPBS`
* as `AZ`
* these, `THEZ KW-BG`
* with `W`
* antlers! `APBT/HRER/-S SKHRAPL`
* I `EU`
* wish `WEURB`
* had `H`
* legs `HREGS`
* more `PHOR`
* worthy `WO*RT/KWREU`
* to `TO`
* bear `PWAER`
* crown; `KROUPB STPH*FPLT`
* it `T`
* is `S`
* pity `PEUT/TEU`
* they `THE`
* are `R`
* so `SO`
* slim `SHREUPL`
* slight." `SHRAOEUT TP-PL KR-GS`
* At `KPA/AT`
* that `THA`
* moment `PHOEPLT`
* Hunter `HURPBT`
* approached `A/PROEFPD`
* sent `SEPBT`
* an `APB`
* arrow `AR/OE`
* whistling `WHEUS/-LG`
* after `AF`
* him. `HEUPL TP-PL`
* Away `KPA/A/WAEU`
* bounded `PWOUPBD/-D`
* Hart, `HA*RT KW-BG`
* soon, `SAOPB KW-BG`
* by `PWEU`
* aid `AEUD`
* of `-F`
* his `HEUS`
* nimble `TPHEUPL/*L`
* legs, `HREGS KW-BG`
* nearly `TPHAOERL`
* out `OUT`
* sight `SAOEUT`
* Hunter; `HURPBT STPH*FPLT`
* but `PWUT`
* not `TPHOT`
* noticing `TPH-TS/-G`
* where `W-R`
* going, `TKPW-G KW-BG`
* passed `PAFD`
* under `TPH-PB`
* some `SOPL`
* trees `TRAOES`
* branches `PWRAFPBS`
* growing `TKPWROEG`
* low `HROE`
* down `TKOUPB`
* in `TPH`
* which `WEU`
* antlers `APBT/HRER/-S`
* were `WR`
* caught, `KAUT KW-BG`
* time `TAOEUPL`
* come `KOPL`
* up. `UP TP-PL`
* "Alas! `KR-GS KPA/A/HRAS SKHRAPL`
* alas!" `A/HRAS SKHRAPL KR-GS`
* cried `KRAOEUD`
* Hart: `HA*RT STPH-FPLT`
* "We `KR-GS KPA/WE`
* often `OFPB`
* despise `STKPAOEUZ`
* what `WHA`
* most `PHOFT`
* useful `AOUFL`
* us." `US TP-PL KR-GS`
