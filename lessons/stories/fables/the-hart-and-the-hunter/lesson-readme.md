* once `WUPBS`
* drinking `TKREUG`
* from `TPR`
* a `AEU`
* pool `PAOL`
* and `SKP`
* admiring `AD/PHAOEURG`
* noble `TPHOEBL`
* figure `TPEUG`
* he `E`
* made `PHAED`
* there. `THR TP-PL`
* "Ah," `KR-GS HA*E KW-BG KR-GS`
* said `SAEUD`
* he, `E KW-BG`
* "where `KR-GS W-R`
* can `K`
* you `U`
* see `SAOE`
* such `SUFP`
* horns `HORPBS`
* as `AZ`
* these, `THEZ KW-BG`
* with `W`

* I `EU`
* wish `WEURB`
* had `H`
* legs `HREGS`
* more `PHOR`
* worthy `WOR/TH*EU`

* moment `PHOEPLT`
* Hunter `HURPBT`
* approached `A/PROEFPD`
* sent `SEPBT`
* an `APB`
* arrow `AR/OE`
* whistling `WHEUS/-LG`
* after `AF`
* him. `HEUPL TP-PL`
* Away `A/WAEU`
* bounded `PWOUPBD/-D`
* Hart, `HA*RT KW-BG`
* soon, `SAOPB KW-BG`
* by `PWEU`
* aid `AEUD`
* of `-F`
* his `HEUS`
* nimble `TPHEUPL/*L`
* legs, `HREGS KW-BG`
* nearly `TPHAOERL`
* out `OUT`

* Hunter; `HURPBT STPH*FPLT`
* but `PWUT`
* not `TPHOT`
* noticing `TPH-TS/-G`
* where `W-R`
