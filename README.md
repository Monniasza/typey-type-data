# Typey Type Data

This project contains data for [Typey Type](https://github.com/didoesdigital/typey-type), a free typing app designed for steno students to practise and master stenography.

## No code contributions at this time

This project is the result of automated scripts that transform Typey Type’s [steno-dictionaries](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries) and other data to produce the files in this repo. You can **create issues** for lesson ideas or inaccurate data. See the [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.
