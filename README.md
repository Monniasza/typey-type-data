# Typey Type Data

This project contains data for [Typey Type](https://github.com/didoesdigital/typey-type), a free typing app designed for steno students to practise and master stenography.

## Sponsor

You can support [Di’s efforts on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/didoesdigital). A monthly donation helps Di build more lessons and features to help you fast-track your steno progress.

## Contributing lessons or dictionaries

To contribute lessons or dictionaries, see the [Typey Type CLI](https://github.com/didoesdigital/typey-type-cli) repo instead.

*This* repo contains the results of automated scripts from the CLI that transform Typey Type’s [steno-dictionaries](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries) and other data to produce the files in this repo.

You can **create issues** for lesson ideas or inaccurate data. See the [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.

## Steno dictionaries git submodule

Historically this repo has contained the [steno-dictionaries](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries) submodule but that has been moved to [Typey Type CLI](https://github.com/didoesdigital/typey-type-cli). If you've been using the paths to these dictionaries in Plover, for example, you may need to update them to look in the CLI's submodule or somewhere standalone. For example, if Plover was looking for:

```
~/projects/typey-type/typey-type-data/didoesdigital/dictionaries
```

… replace that with:

```
~/projects/typey-type-cli/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/dictionaries
```

… or a completely separate place like:

```
~/steno/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/dictionaries
```
