# Contributing to Typey Type Data

ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

## No code contributions at this time

This project is the result of automated scripts that transform Typey Typeâ€™s [steno-dictionaries](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries) and other data to produce the files in this repo. You can **create issues** for lesson ideas or inaccurate data.

## Issues

You can explore or create [issues](https://github.com/didoesdigital/issues) to track ideas, enhancements, or bugs. Use issues to track:

- Missing documentation
- Ideas for lessons, dictionaries, and recommendations
- Inaccurate data
- Feedback about how you learn stenography

Before creating an issue, search existing [issues](https://github.com/didoesdigital/issues) to see if any relevant issues already exist.

You can also add lessons directly to the communityâ€™s lessons spreadsheet. See [Typey Type lessons](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/lessons) to learn more.

## Sponsor

You can support [Diâ€™s efforts on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/didoesdigital). A monthly donation helps Di build more lessons and features to help you fast-track your steno progress.
